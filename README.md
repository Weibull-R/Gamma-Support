Gamma-Support
=============

Development of gamma distribution support for WeibullR
------------------------------------------------------

Development is proceeding under a temporary package name wrg, which is dependent
on WeibullR and will progressively mask certain functions in WeibullR as support
for the gamma distribution is expanded.

Since this is a package requiring compilation, a Windows binary will be
maintained for ease of installation for users unaccustomed to utilizing build
tools.
